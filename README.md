Classification - Brand Prediction

1.	SCOPE
Analyze using data mining and modeling methods, the dataset supplied by the CTO and head of Blackwell's eCommerce Team – the goal is to predict the preferred computer brand (Sony/Asus) based on a survey realized to users..
This dataset contains general information about possible costumers such as salary, age, education level, type of car, location, credit and preferred computer brand.

2.	OBJECTIVES
•	Clean, transform and preprocess the dataset.
•	Determine relationships between variables. 
•	Verify and select important features used in the predictive models.
•	Optimize and tune the selected algorithms.
•	Predict the computer brand based on the survey and the data set supplied.

3.	METHODOLOGY
The approach used to assess the dataset was to apply basics methods of data mining, descriptive statistics and simple charting to observe the distribution and relationships between variables (features) in our dataset.
In addition, R (Rstudio) helped with the evaluation of histograms, scatter plots, decision trees, and with the cleaning / transformation of the data.
On the other hand, for the classification and regression modeling, the algorithms used were k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and a Tree Based Model (CART) found in the Caret R package, these algorithms were tuned according to each own parameters.
